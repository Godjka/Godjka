### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

My name is JoÃ£o Antunes and I'm a Mechanical Engineer. My background is in Control theory and I started my carreer as a vehicle dynamicist. My day to day, is spent building from simple (point mass) to complex 14+ DOF models, that help simulate vehicle's in a variety of scenarios.

To help me build these types of simulation I rely on Python, C#, VB.NET, MATLAB, QT, Python-Django and HTML.

I'm very interested in vehicle dynamics and autonomous cars. Feel free to reach out!
